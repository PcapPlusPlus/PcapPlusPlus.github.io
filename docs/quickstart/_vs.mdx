import ReleaseLink from '@site/src/components/ReleaseLink';

### Step 1 - install PcapPlusPlus

Before installing PcapPlusPlus make sure you have the prerequisites installed for [Visual Studio](./install/vs#prerequisites). Please notice that the currently supported versions of Visual Studio are 2019 and 2022.

Download the pre-compiled package for the Visual Studio version you have (VS2019 or VS2022) from the <ReleaseLink/>.

### Step 2 - create your first app

Go to: `Drive:\path\to\your\package\ExampleProject`.

Make sure you see the following files:

```shell
 |-- main.cpp
 |-- 1_packet.pcap
 |-- CMakeLists.txt
```

`main.cpp` is the example application we'll use.

`1_packet.pcap` is a pcap file the app reads from.

`CMakeLists.txt` will help us build the app.

### Step 3 - build and run your app

Configure CMake:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="vs2019" label="VS2019" default>

```cmd
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -S . -B build -DPcapPlusPlus_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\your\package -DPCAP_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\npcap-sdk -DPacket_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\npcap-sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="vs2022" label="VS2022">

```cmd
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -S . -B build -DPcapPlusPlus_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\your\package -DPCAP_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\npcap-sdk -DPacket_ROOT=Drive:\path\to\npcap-sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Build the app:

```cmd
cmake --build build
```

An executable file will be created which contains the compiled app. You can now run it and should be able to see the following output:

```cmd
example-app.exe
Source IP is '10.0.0.138'; Dest IP is '10.0.0.1'
```
