On the other hand, parsed packets are packets that contain all protocol data and can be edited per protocol. This reveals one of the core functionalities of PcapPlusPlus: taking raw packets that were captured from the network and create parsed packets out of them, meaning identifying their protocols, saving meta data about these protocols, and allowing the user easy access to all of this parsed data for both reading and writing (edit, add data and remove data)."),(0,r.kt)("h3",{id:"layers"},"Layers"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"A layer in PcapPlusPlus means protocol layer.

A layer class exposes the protocol's data for the user to read and usually also to write or modify. For example: A TCP layer exposes all TCP fields like ports, flags, sequence numbers, TCP options, etc. and also allows editing of all of those fields and also adding/removing/editing TCP options. Layers inside a parsed packet are ordered in a link list so the parsed packet actually points only to the first (lowest) layer (for example: Ethernet), this layer points to the next layer (for example: IPv4), and so on.
